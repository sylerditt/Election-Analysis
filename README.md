## Challenge Overview
We used python via VS Code to determine the results of the election. Using the csv file, we read the data and consolidated it into the needed information. In this case, we pulled the candidates, their total votes, and determined their percentage of overall votes based on the total votes cast. We used python to input the necessary information into the election_analysis.txt file in VS code then pushed it to GitHub. 
## Challenge Summary
Diana DeGette won the vote based on our analysis as she had the most votes cast in her favor, 73.8% of the vote.
